/**
 * `FieldMask` represents a set of symbolic field paths, for example:
 *
 *      paths: "f.a"     paths: "f.b.d"
 *
 *  Here `f` represents a field in some root message, `a` and `b` fields in the message found in
 * `f`, and `d` a field found in the message in `f.b`.
 *
 *  Field masks are used to specify a subset of fields that should be returned by a get operation or
 * modified by an update operation. Field masks also have a custom JSON encoding (see below).
 *
 *  # Field Masks in Projections
 *
 *  When used in the context of a projection, a response message or sub-message is filtered by the
 * API to only contain those fields as specified in the mask. For example, if the mask in the previous
 * example is applied to a response message as follows:
 *
 *      f {       a : 22       b {         d : 1         x : 2       }       y : 13     }     z: 8
 *
 *  The result will not contain specific values for fields x,y and z (their value will be set to the
 * default, and omitted in proto text output):
 *
 *
 *
 *      f {       a : 22       b {         d : 1       }     }
 *
 *  A repeated field is not allowed except at the last position of a paths string.
 *
 *  If a FieldMask object is not present in a get operation, the operation applies to all fields (as
 * if a FieldMask of all fields had been specified).
 *
 *  Note that a field mask does not necessarily apply to the top-level response message. In case of
 * a REST get operation, the field mask applies directly to the response, but in case of a REST list
 * operation, the mask instead applies to each individual message in the returned resource list. In
 * case of a REST custom method, other definitions may be used. Where the mask applies will be clearly
 * documented together with its declaration in the API.  In any case, the effect on the returned
 * resource/resources is required behavior for APIs.
 *
 *  # Field Masks in Update Operations
 *
 *  A field mask in update operations specifies which fields of the targeted resource are going to
 * be updated. The API is required to only change the values of the fields as specified in the mask and
 * leave the others untouched. If a resource is passed in to describe the updated values, the API
 * ignores the values of all fields not covered by the mask.
 *
 *  If a repeated field is specified for an update operation, new values will be appended to the
 * existing repeated field in the target resource. Note that a repeated field is only allowed in the
 * last position of a `paths` string.
 *
 *  If a sub-message is specified in the last position of the field mask for an update operation,
 * then new value will be merged into the existing sub-message in the target resource.
 *
 *  For example, given the target message:
 *
 *      f {       b {         d: 1         x: 2       }       c: [1]     }
 *
 *  And an update message:
 *
 *      f {       b {         d: 10       }       c: [2]     }
 *
 *  then if the field mask is:
 *
 *   paths: ["f.b", "f.c"]
 *
 *  then the result will be:
 *
 *      f {       b {         d: 10         x: 2       }       c: [1, 2]     }
 *
 *  An implementation may provide options to override this default behavior for repeated and message
 * fields.
 *
 *  In order to reset a field's value to the default, the field must be in the mask and set to the
 * default value in the provided resource. Hence, in order to reset all fields of a resource, provide a
 * default instance of the resource and set all fields in the mask, or do not provide a mask as
 * described below.
 *
 *  If a field mask is not present on update, the operation applies to all fields (as if a field
 * mask of all fields has been specified). Note that in the presence of schema evolution, this may mean
 * that fields the client does not know and has therefore not filled into the request will be reset to
 * their default. If this is unwanted behavior, a specific service may require a client to always
 * specify a field mask, producing an error if not.
 *
 *  As with get operations, the location of the resource which describes the updated values in the
 * request message depends on the operation kind. In any case, the effect of the field mask is required
 * to be honored by the API.
 *
 *  ## Considerations for HTTP REST
 *
 *  The HTTP kind of an update operation which uses a field mask must be set to PATCH instead of PUT
 * in order to satisfy HTTP semantics (PUT must only be used for full updates).
 *
 *  # JSON Encoding of Field Masks
 *
 *  In JSON, a field mask is encoded as a single string where paths are separated by a comma. Fields
 * name in each path are converted to/from lower-camel naming conventions.
 *
 *  As an example, consider the following message declarations:
 *
 *      message Profile {       User user = 1;       Photo photo = 2;     }     message User {
 * string display_name = 1;       string address = 2;     }
 *
 *  In proto a field mask for `Profile` may look as such:
 *
 *      mask {       paths: "user.display_name"       paths: "photo"     }
 *
 *  In JSON, the same mask is represented as below:
 *
 *      {       mask: "user.displayName,photo"     }
 *
 *  # Field Masks and Oneof Fields
 *
 *  Field masks treat fields in oneofs just as regular fields. Consider the following message:
 *
 *      message SampleMessage {       oneof test_oneof {         string name = 4;         SubMessage
 * sub_message = 9;       }     }
 *
 *  The field mask can be:
 *
 *      mask {       paths: "name"     }
 *
 *  Or:
 *
 *      mask {       paths: "sub_message"     }
 *
 *  Note that oneof type names ("test_oneof" in this case) cannot be used in paths.
 *
 *  ## Field Mask Verification
 *
 *  The implementation of any API method which has a FieldMask type field in the request should
 * verify the included field paths, and return an `INVALID_ARGUMENT` error if any path is unmappable.
